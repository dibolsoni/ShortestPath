# ShortestPath

This is a my version of Shortest Path Algorithm inspired in [Edsger Dijkstra Shortest Path Alogorithm (1959)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) using Python3.

> The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,[6] but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

Todo:
- [x] Shortest path on 1 level.
- [x] Shortest path on 2 levels.
- [ ] Shortest path on 3 levels.
- [ ] Shortest path on infinity levels.
- [ ] Better Refactor.
- [ ] Optimization.


## Implementation example in main.py
```python
python3 main.py
```
